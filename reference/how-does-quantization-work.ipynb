Quantization of a Single Value\nQuantization is the process of constraining an input from a large set to output in a smaller set. In the context of deep learning, it's used to reduce the precision of the weights and activations of the neural network models. This can help to reduce the memory footprint and computational intensity of models. Here, we'll start by quantizing a single floating point number.\n\nWe'll define two functions: one to quantize a value and another to unquantize it. The quantize function will take a floating point number and a number of bits, and will output an integer representation of the input number. The unquantize function will take the integer and the number of bits, and will output the floating point number.\n\nThe range of input values for the quantize function is between -1 and 1. The range of output values for the unquantize function is also between -1 and 1. The number of bits determines the precision of the quantization. More bits means higher precision, but more memory usage.

Quantization of a Simple Neural Network\nNext, let's apply quantization to a neural network. We'll create a simple network with one hidden layer, then we'll quantize and dequantize its weights.\n\nIn PyTorch, [quantization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html) is achieved using a `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub` to mark the points in the model where the data needs to be converted to quantized form and converted back to floating point form, respectively. After defining the network with these stubs, we use the `torch.quantization.prepare` and `torch.quantization.convert` functions to quantize the model.\n\nThe process of quantizing a model in PyTorch involves the following steps:\n\n- Define a neural network and mark the points in the model where the data needs to be converted to quantized form and converted back to floating point form. This is done using a `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub`.\n- Specify a quantization configuration for the model using `torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig`. This sets up the quantization parameters.\n- Prepare the model for quantization using `torch.quantization.prepare`. This function replaces specified modules in the model with their quantized counterparts.\n- Calibrate the model on a calibration dataset. During calibration, the model is run on a calibration dataset and the range of the activations is observed. This is used to determine the parameters for quantization.\n- Convert the prepared and calibrated model to a quantized version using torch.quantization.convert.

These values are used in the computations performed by the layer, and they directly affect the layer's output.\n- `Size`: This is the shape of the weight or bias tensor and it should be the same in both the original and quantized model. In a fully-connected layer, this corresponds to the number of neurons in the current layer and the number of neurons in the previous layer.\n- `Dtype`: In the original model, the data type of the tensor values is usually torch.float32 (32-bit floating point), whereas in the quantized model it is a quantized data type like torch.qint8 (8-bit quantized integer). This reduces the memory usage and computational requirements of the model.\n- `Quantization_scheme`: This is specific to the quantized model. It is the type of quantization used, for example, torch.per_channel_affine means different channels (e.g., neurons in a layer) can have different scale and zero_point values.\n- `Scale & Zero Point`: These are parameters of the quantization process and are specific to the quantized model. They are used to convert between the quantized and dequantized forms of the tensor values.\n- `Axis`: This indicates the dimension along which the quantization parameters vary. This is also specific to the quantized model.\n- `Requires_grad`: This indicates whether the tensor is a model parameter that is updated during training.
